That being said, other than the introduction of an optional pair of pop-up third-row jump seats, we aren't forecasting any major design or technology upgrades this year.Like the Model 3, the Model Y lineup includes a Standard Range cost-leader trim which is essentially a rear-wheel-drive version of the Long Range model. The more compelling options are the all-wheel-drive Long Range and Performance models. Thanks to a generous Car and Driver reader, we were able to test an all-wheel-drive Long Range, which zipped from zero-to-60 mph in just 4.4 seconds, a mere 0.4 second behind our long-term Model 3 sedan. While the Model Y offers impressive acceleration, it doesn't deliver the same level of driving satisfaction as the Model 3.</p>
