The electric sedan with the liftback design form is available in a choice of three variants- 75D, 100D and the P100D which is the top of the line. The P100D in its ludicrous mode can do a 100kmph from a standstill in a mere 2.5 seconds.

Us Indians will have to wait a long time to witness these hair raising numbers. At least until there are proper and stable policies and infrastructure in place regarding the EVs. For the time being, you can just check out the first Tesla Model X that landed in India here.</p>
